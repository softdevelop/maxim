<h3 id="started">Getting started</h3>
<hr>

<p>As you know, this being a WordPress theme it needs WordPress to work. To install it you MUST have WordPress installed first. If you don't have WordPress installed, or if you need more information about WordPress, please see the WordPress site and the WordPress Codex -<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" target="_blank" >http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress</a>.</p>

<h3 id="installing">Installing the theme</h3>
<hr>

<p>With WordPress installed on your server you are ready to install the theme. To do so you have to upload it to the server and then activate it. You can do this one way or another. It's up to you:</p>

<p>1. Through an FTP program: Upload the theme files into the /wp-content/themes/ folder. That's where all the themes go. If you need an FTP program, use this - <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" >http://filezilla-project.org/</a>. It's free.</p>
		
<p>2. Using the WordPress Upload: You can upload the zipped theme file using the WordPress built in upload system. To do so go to Appearance > Themes > Install Themes > Upload, browse and select the zipped file, click Install Now and the theme will be automatically uploaded and installed in the themes folder.</p>

<p>Now, as the theme is uploaded and installed, it needs to be activated. Go to Appearance > Themes and activate the newly uploaded theme.</p>

<p>Make sure you install and activate all the required plugins as some of them are needed for the theme to work properly.</p>


<h3 id="setting">Setting Up The Homepage</h3>
<hr>

<p>After you installed the theme the frontpage will only show some blog posts. You have to tell WordPress that you want a certain page to be the homepage. First go to “Pages“ and create a new page. Call it “Home“ and chose the template “Home“ from the dropdown to the right. Now go to “Setting – Reading”, mark “A static page” and chose the page you just created as frontpage. Now go to “Appearance-Theme Option“ and then “Homepage“ and chose the desired homepage layout. On the same page you can upload the pictures to the boxes and link them to a desired page.</p>


<p>You can change the basic setting by goin to “Apperance – Theme Options”. Here you can upload you own logo, change colors and add a footer text. Always make sure to save all changes.</p>


<p>If you want to start with some dummy content simply install our XML file. Go to “Tools-Import” and Click on “WordPress”. Chose the XML provided in the .zip-file you downloaded from ThemeForest and we automatically add some dummy content.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="logo">Change The Logo</h3>
<hr>

<p>After installing the theme you can change the logo by going to “Appearance-Theme Options”. You will find the option “Logo” and “sticky menu logo“ That's because Maxim works with two logos. The first is the one you can find on the top left. The second one is the one that will appear on the sticky menu when you scroll down.</p> 

<p>In Gone – every page can have its own logo. Underneath the input field for the content of the page you will find a box called “Page Extra”. Upload a logo here to override the main logo for that page (“Page Extra” not showing? On the top right of the page – click “Screen Options” – check “Page Extras”)</p>

<h3 id="menuset">Setting Up The Menu</h3>
<hr>

<p>You can create a menu for Maxim as you would do for any other theme. Go to “Appereance-Menus” and drag and drop the sites you want into the menu area. If you can not find a specific page make sure to check if the box that contains the site is displayed: On the top right of the page – click “Screen Options” and then check all areas you want to display.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: You have to tell WordPress that this is the menu you want to use as primary menu! Scroll to the bottom of the page and check “Theme location – Primary Menu”</p>


<h4 id="megamenu">How to use the mega menu</h4>

<p>Maxim features a mega menu. Setting it up is quite easy. First you want to upload an image to use as a background for the mega menu. The image should be small to make the menu work properly. Keep in mind that the image will always be right aligned! Go to “Appereance-Theme Option“ Scroll doen to Mega menu images. Upload your image(s) and save your changes. Name the elements 1,2,3 etc. Now go to “Appereances-Menus“
Click on the arrow at the right of any menu item. You will find the inputfield called “CSS Clases“ (If not, on the top right of the page – click “Screen Options” and then check all areas you want to display, including CSS Classes) in here type the words “mega-menu mega-menu1“ The number after the second “mega-menu“ is the number for the image you uploaded in the theme options. For example if you uploaded three images in the theme options in the mega menu image area, to show the second image as background image write “mega-menu mega-menu2“. </p> 

<p class="toggle_handle">click to toggle image</p>
<div>
	<a style="width: 70%; display: inline-block;" href="images/megamenu.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/megamenu.png"></a>
</div>


<p>The next step is to create heading for the rows within the mega menu. Create a dummy menu item for this. You can create a dummy menu item by chosing “Links”. Add “#” as “URL” an a name of your choice for “Link Text”. “Links” is not showing as an option? On the top right of the page – click “Screen Options” – check “Links”</p>

<p class="toggle_handle">click to toggle image</p>
<div>
	<a style="width: 70%; display: inline-block;" href="images/menu2.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/menu2.png"></a>
</div>

<p>Underneath your headings you can now add all the pages, posts etc. you want!</p>

<h3 id="bgslider">Background Slider</h3>
<hr>
<p>There is an option to add a default background image. Go to “Appearance-Theme options” Scroll downs a bit and you’ll find a field to upload images for your background slider. Make sure to click on the save button for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Every page can have its own background slider. Simply open the page you want to add a background slider to.  Underneath the input field for the content of the page you will find a box called “Page Extra”. Here you can upload your background images (“Page Extra” not showing? On the top right of the page – click “Screen Options” – check “Page Extras”)</p>


<h3 id="setupblog">How to setup the blog</h3>
<hr>
<p>Create a page called “Blog“. Now go to “Settings-Reading“ and chose that page as blog page. Under “Appereance-Theme Option“ you can chose the style of the blog page</p>

<h3 id="setuptwc">How to setup the Team, Work, Gallery and Clients pages</h3>
<hr>

<p>Setting up these “portfolio pages“ is really simple. Just create a new page and chose the “team“, “work“ "gallery“ or “client“ template from the dropdown to the right. These pages will be the overview pages of the items and you should add them to the menu of your website to make them accessable. You can create new items for Team, Work and Clients by adding posts to these custom post types in the backend. ATTENTION: Whe creating a gallery item keep in mind that the titel of the page and the text you add to the editor will be also shown. When you want to add images, simply click on the “Add Media“ button above the editor. Now drag and drop your images on the pop up that opens. DO NOT click on “insert in post“! Simply close the pop up (click “x“) and save the page as you would normally would. The images are already “in“ the post, you simply cannot see them in the backend ;)</p>

<h3 id="add-tw">How to add twitter</h3>
<hr>

<p>In order to add twitter, you'll need what is called a consumer key and secret to identify your app. To obtain these, you must register an application with Twitter by following these steps.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">Go to the registration page</a>, logging in if necessary. You'll be greeted by a form. Fill the required fields and click the Create your twitter application. Then, on the API keys tab click the Create my access token button.</p>

<p>You would then need to copy to the theme options the Access token code, Access token secret code, API key code and API secret code.</p>

<h3 id="tweak-code">How to tweak the code</h3>
<hr>

<p>Making small code changes to any theme is really simple if you know how to do it. My default browser is Firefox and I'm using a really helpful add-on called Firebug to quickly identify sections of the site and CSS style rules applied to those sections. Below is a small example on how you can use Firefox to do that.</p>

<p class="toggle_handle">click to toggle image</p>
<div>
	<a style="width: 70%; display: inline-block;" href="images/css.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/css.png"></a>
</div>

<h4 id="tweak-logo">How to tweak the logo position code</h4>

<p>If you need to modify the site's logo position you would have to modify this css line that's on styles.css at line 45. You could modify it there, or by adding the css rule to the CSS section of the theme options. This section code overrides any theme default code.</p>

<code style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: inline-block;">
#logo { padding-top: 44px; }
</code>

<h4 id="tweak-menu-font">How to change the main menu font size</h4>

<p>If you need to modify the site's main menu font size you would have to modify this css line that's on styles.css at line 495. You could modify it there, or by adding the css rule to the CSS section of the theme options. This section code overrides any theme default code.</p>

<code style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: inline-block;">
<pre>
.main-menu ul li a {
    font-size: 13px;
}
</pre>
</code>

<h4 id="tweak-footer">How to modify the footer</h4>

<p>If you need to modify the footer you would have to modify this css line that's on styles.css at line 802. You could modify it there, or by adding the css rule to the CSS section of the theme options. This section code overrides any theme default code. From here you can modify the space from the top or bottom of the footer, footer font color or footer font size. You could also add this CSS rule <code>text-align: right;</code> if you want the footer text to be right aligned. There is also a theme option for that in the theme options page.</p>

<code style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: inline-block;">
<pre>
#footer p {
    color: #454545;
    font-size: 11px;
    margin: 35px 0 0;
    padding-bottom: 30px;
}
</pre>
</code>

<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<hr>

<h4 id="multilanguage">How can I make it multi language ready?</h4>

<p>We made sure that Maxim is working with the wpml.org plugin – the industry standard for multi language plugins.  So if you want it multilanguage ready we recommend using this plugin.</p>
